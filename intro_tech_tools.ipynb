    "\n",
    "We would like to help you establish (what we think) good practices in data management and programming/scripting. Therefore we use (and partially enforce the use) of the following tools in this exercise series:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git` version control and `GitLab` (to collaborate on code)\n",
    "- `PostgreSQL` database management\n",
    "- `Visual Studio Code` IDE (of course, you are free to use any editor you like - extra points for emacs or Vim users ;)\n",
    "- `python`, `pip` and `venv` (virtual environments, you may also use conda if you prefer)\n",
    "\n",
    "This document introduces these tools and hints to additional resources. We know, it is a lot to take in at once. But you can use this document as a reference for the course. Apart from the python code that you will have to write to conduct the analysis, you should find a simple example for every command (of the other tools) that we need in this course which you can slightly adjust to suit your needs."

    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and software literacy should be an integral part of any academic (hard science) education. We would like you to get acquainted with some of the most frequently used tools where you hopefully experience their power throughout the hands-on exercise series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me explain to you why we need these tools in the context of this lecture: You will have to conduct simple data analysis and perform optimizations which requires you to code in [`python`](https://www.python.org/) (one of the most popular programming languages).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be learned relatively easily (read the [docs](https://www.python.org/doc/)). As with any programming language, you should familiarize yourself with the basic building blocks of the programming language, which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data types (e.g. integer, string, Boolean)\n",
    "- Variables\n",
    "- Operators (e.g. arithmetic, comparison, logical)\n",
    "- Control structures (e.g. if-else statements, loops)\n",
    "- Functions or subroutines\n",
    "- Input/output statements\n",
    "- Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "These building blocks can be combined to create statements and expressions, which are then used to write programs (I've asked [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to write down these basic building blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyways, understanding these blocks is relatively simple and the power of using a language usually comes from its package ecosystem. A `package` is a collection of code (usually functions or objects and methods) which provide domain functionality (e.g. the [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package which provides powerful data analyis tools such as the `pandas.DataFrame` object and its associated methods). When learning how to use that functionality, it is not so much about learning complicated coding but simply about reading the documentation and understanding what function/method accomplishes what and what arguments you need to feed (more on this in the [Getting help](#getting-help) section).\n",
    "\n",
    "> A sidenote on packages: You should not feel intimidated to write your own packages. A package (in any programming language) is just a conveniently structured repository following given conventions. You are welcome to learn more by following this [simple tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) on how to write a minimal package in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn how to easily install packages with `pip` - the python package manger. Every analysis should be reproducable, i.e. anyone should be able to arrive at the same output given the input (i.e. raw data) preferably on any system (e.g. mac, windows, linux). Therefore we want to encapsulate our environment such that it is easily portable and can be shared with others (students, researchers, the public, etc.). For this purpose we install the packages into so-called *virtuel environments* (`venv`).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the note of reproducibility: You yourself sometimes are not sure what your alter ego did. (Automatically) documenting the different stages of your development and project work therefore makes sense. Further, you sometimes do something wrong or want to revert your work to a previous state. Therefore a version control system (`git`) is a very powerful tool. It also allows you to collaborate effectively, without having to worry to overwrite your colleagues state of work!\n",
    "\n",
    "[`GitLab`](https://about.gitlab.com/) is just the hosting platform where you can mirror your local project structure and share your work with the world (or with us for grading).\n",
    "\n",
    "Sooner or later, you will realize that sharing and managing (raw) data with `.csv` files or other formats is very cumbersome. For example, a .csv file lives only on the local computer and if you want to share it you have to physically copy and share the file (that is the data gets duplicated). Or have you ever (tried) to open an excel spreadsheet containing some GB of data just to get a feel for what it actually contains? As you will individually collect your raw data for the analysis (through surveying bus users) and share it with the rest of the class, we will use `PostgreSQL`. The database will be hosted on a server and therefore we can easily pull/access the data in our python scripts with help of the `psycopg` python package.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Of course you can also run a Postgres DB on your local computer and organize your personal data without the need of a server (a server is just a computer system attached to a network).\n",
    "\n",
    "[`Visual Studio Code`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is just an *Interactive Development Enviornment*, i.e. a text editor with superpowers such as syntax highlighting, autocompletions, syntax highlighting, signature help, integrated REPL, etc. You are free to use another one you like (for exmample PyCharm is another popular choice). While *Jupyter Notebooks* are very neat, they have some limitations in data analysis (for example code output and chronology of ran cells gets stored in the very file which makes it difficult to version control). Personally, I have a preference for general purpose tools such that you do not have to learn/use a new environment when you switch the language...\n",

    "\n",
    "We have cloned the repository `PuvIntro` which is hosted on my gitlab page (i.e. we made a local versioned copy of it). Subsequently, we've created a virtual environment and told our IDE to use it when interpreting python code. We could conveniently explore the functions by locally installing our package. We have installed all the dependencies that would be required to run our code from the `requirements.txt` file. That is, we are all on the same page: We all have the same version of the PuvIntro project and this project is evaluated in the exactly same environemnt (Sideremark: maybe you have a slightly different python3 version, but this does not matter for now). We then extended the project's functionality and made it publicly available on gitlab. This allows others to leverage the functionality and explore the project evolution and contribute to your code without messing it up with help of `git`. So the full cycle is (clone), pull, change a bit, commit meaningful chunks, push, restart the game, ...\n",

I focus on the key commands that you should know. The basic usage is `pip install package`. However, this installs the package to the system's python site-packages directory (so globally). If you have several python versions installed (e.g. on linux you usually have both python2 and python3) then it is not clear to which python version the pip command installs to as pip as well as pip3 are associated with one particular python version.
